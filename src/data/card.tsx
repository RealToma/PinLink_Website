ERC1155 tokens work by offering a modular approach to tokenization, which splits their architecture into a separate ERC-20 contract and mirror ERC-721 NFT contract. The ERC-20 contract is dedicated to representing the fractional portions of the NFT. Meanwhile, the ERC-721 NFT contract helps track the relationship between the NFT and its fractionalized owners. Taken together, this provides the most efficient framework for allowing multiple holders to own a partial share of the RWA-tokenized DePIN asset.",

Each NFT holder will receive a personalized name and picture, along with a tracking dashboard showing the earning that NFT has accumulated from renting out underlying capacity. As different NFT assets will attract different levels of revenue, the earning dashboard will also create a competitive dynamic between different DePIN asset owners. They will be competing to sell fractionalized shares of their NFT to other users who will be attracted to the highest earning assets.",
